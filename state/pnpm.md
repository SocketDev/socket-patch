[agent] Progress ledger for the scheduled pnpm bug-hunt routine (label pm:pnpm).

Last updated: 2026-10-01 (run 3), main `2463257` (#277, the v5 consolidation), latest release 4.0.0.

Method: real pnpm installs. Hosted, vendored and global agent mode run against a local Python mock of the patch API (batch, by-package, view with inline blobs, package grant, hosted tarball, `/registry/<name>/<ver>` mirror). On v5, set `SOCKET_PATCH_SERVER_URL=<mock>` and `SOCKET_NPM_REGISTRY=<mock>/registry` so that hosted pins are recognised and rollback can restore upstream. The oracle is a marker prepended to `index.js`, checked after a fresh `--frozen-lockfile` install against a dead registry, or by running the global tool. The repo's pinned matrix (`.github/workflows/pnpm-compatibility.yml`) already covers plain hosted and vendored installs on pnpm 1–12. This ledger tracks what it doesn't.

"Edge shapes" means a whole-document flow mapping, a `...` document end, and quoted or `key :` top-level keys.

## Backlog

0. **Maintainer request (global `-g` mode):** the Linux cells are done. Still to do: macOS and Windows (corepack, standalone and npm-installed pnpm; `PNPM_HOME` with spaces or unicode; Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pnpm`), and an unwritable prefix as a non-root user. Full checklist in the 20261001T040000Z entry. Needs a probe branch.
1. Delete the stale probe branch `bughunt/pnpm/20260930-virtual-store`. `git push --delete` has failed through the git proxy in runs 1 and 3 (and was denied in run 2), so a maintainer needs to do it. macOS and Windows probes stay on hold until branch cleanup works.
2. Hosted on v5: Rush / subspace locks, peer-suffixed workspace instances, and catalogs, using the `SOCKET_PATCH_SERVER_URL` / `SOCKET_NPM_REGISTRY` harness.
3. Hosted `--frozen-lockfile --offline` with a warm store holding the upstream tarball, on pnpm 9–12. Check that `vex` doesn't attest unpatched installed bytes.
4. Agent: `dependenciesMeta.injected`, `package-import-method=clone|copy`, and pnpm 1–6 legacy layouts (Node 16).
5. Vendored on Windows and macOS (autocrlf: expect the `vendor_lockfile_crlf_unsupported` refusal; check that hosted handles the same checkout). Needs a probe branch.
6. Re-verify #360, #361, #362 (PR #365), #400 and #402 (PR #414), and #435 when fixes land.

## Known non-bugs

- `patches-api.socket.dev` and (for the Rust client) `registry.npmjs.org` are unreachable from the sandbox. Mock the API and point `SOCKET_NPM_REGISTRY` at a mirror.
- v5 recognises hosted pins only on the configured patch server. Against a mock without `SOCKET_PATCH_SERVER_URL`, `rollback` says "Manifest not found". That's a fixture artifact.
- v5 hosted rollback and takeover keep a user-edited `trustLockfile: true` and warn `pnpm_trust_lockfile_left`. A workspace file that exactly matches hosted mode's scaffold is deleted, including a user's own `packages: ['.']` file that the trust append made identical to it (CLI_CONTRACT, upstream restore).
- pnpm 10 ignores `enableGlobalVirtualStore` when `CI` is set, so the global-virtual-store cells don't engage on GH runners with pnpm 10.
- pnpm 12 (and 11) ignore `.npmrc` for `virtual-store-dir` / `enable-global-virtual-store`. Put them in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, or in the global `config.yaml`.
- pnpm 11+ `pnpm root -g` / `pnpm add -g` fail unless `$PNPM_HOME/bin` is on `PATH`. Put it there in fixtures.
- Vendored refusals that are intended, loud and fail-closed: a CRLF `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`vendor_lockfile_crlf_unsupported`), a BOM package.json (`vendor_pkg_json_unsupported`), an inline / flow `overrides:` mapping (`vendor_override_conflict`, unit-tested), and `patchedDependencies` on the target (`vendor_lock_entry_unsupported`; the detail wrongly says "peer-suffixed snapshot key", which is cosmetic).
- Vendored `vex` attests from the committed artifact plus lock wiring even when the tree isn't installed. That's by design (CLI_CONTRACT "Manifest-less VEX").
- `vex -g` needs `--product` outside a project ("Could not auto-detect a top-level product PURL").
- Agent-mode `get <purl>` for an uninstalled package reports `success, applied: 1` when another manifest entry applies. The nested apply fails only when nothing matches. It's not pnpm-specific (noted on #362).
- A compact single-line `package.json` comes back 2-space-indented after vendor + rollback. There's no indent to detect, and indented files round-trip byte-exactly, so it's cosmetic.
- A `vex --output /dev/stdout` hang when stdout is a pipe is not pnpm-specific.
