The `Release` workflow refuses to publish a version that does not appear
in this file — see `.github/workflows/release.yml` (`version` job).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Telemetry coverage for read-side + housekeeping + attestation commands.**
  `scan`, `get`, `list`, `setup`, `repair`, `unlock`, and the new `vex`
  command each emit a `patch_<action>` (and matching `*_failed`) event
  through the existing send path, joining the apply/remove/rollback
  trio that already shipped. The `scan` event carries per-tier counts
  (`free_patches`/`paid_patches`/`can_access_paid`), the ecosystems
  filter, and a `fallback_to_proxy` flag; `get` carries
  `uuid`/`tier`/`ecosystem`/`download_mode`/`fallback_to_proxy`.

- **`scan` + `get` automatically fall back to the public proxy on
  401/403** from the authenticated endpoint. A stale or revoked
  token no longer blocks access to free patches — the CLI logs a
  warning to stderr, swaps to the proxy, retries once, and tags the
  resulting telemetry event with `fallback_to_proxy: true`. The
  classifier is deliberately narrow: 404, 5xx, network, and rate-limit
  errors do NOT trigger fallback so backend issues stay visible.
  `apply`/`remove`/`rollback`/`vex` keep their fail-loud semantics.

- **`SOCKET_OFFLINE` (airgap mode) now disables telemetry universally.**
  `is_telemetry_disabled()` honors the same `SOCKET_OFFLINE=1|true`
  signal `--offline` uses for network suppression, so apply (and
  every future command) no longer attempts a 5-second telemetry POST
  against `https://api.socket.dev` when the operator explicitly
  requested airgap.

### Tests

- New `tests/telemetry_e2e.rs` end-to-end behavioral coverage:
  apply/scan/get/list emit telemetry against a wiremock recorder;
  `SOCKET_OFFLINE=1` produces zero telemetry POSTs across all four;
  scan falls back on 401 + tags the resulting event; scan does NOT
  fall back on 500 (conservative classifier).
- New `scan_invariants` cases for the patch-management lifecycle:
  withdrawn patches keep their entry when the package is still
  installed but API is silent; entries for uninstalled packages get
  pruned; `scan` without `--apply` is read-only against the manifest
  and blobs even when an update is detected.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-22

### Breaking

- **`--offline` semantics unified** to strict airgap on every subcommand.
  Previously meant three different things across `apply` (strict airgap),
  `repair` (skip downloads / cleanup-only), and `rollback` (fail when blobs
  missing). All three now mean the same thing: never contact the network,
  fail loudly when a required local source is missing.
- **`repair --download-mode` default** changed from `file` to `diff` to
  match every other subcommand. Users who need the legacy per-file blob
  behavior must now opt in with `--download-mode file`.
- **`repair --offline` is mutually exclusive with `--download-only`** —
  passing both exits with code 2.
- **Env vars renamed.** The three remaining `SOCKET_PATCH_*` env vars now
  use the `SOCKET_*` prefix:
  - `SOCKET_PATCH_PROXY_URL` → `SOCKET_PROXY_URL`
  - `SOCKET_PATCH_DEBUG` → `SOCKET_DEBUG`
  - `SOCKET_PATCH_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` → `SOCKET_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`

  The legacy names are still honored at runtime but emit a one-shot
  deprecation warning to stderr (the warning fires even under `--silent`
  and `--json` because the transition signal must reach scripts and CI
  logs). Legacy names will be removed in v4.

### Added

- Shared `GlobalArgs` clap struct `#[command(flatten)]`-ed into every
  subcommand. Every flag is now accepted on every subcommand (silently
  no-op'd where the subcommand doesn't consume it). Every flag has a
  matching `SOCKET_*` env-var binding with precedence
  `CLI arg > env var > default`. See `CLI_CONTRACT.md` for the full
  global-arguments table.
- `apply` and `repair` accept `--api-url`, `--api-token`, `--org` via the
  global flatten (previously env-var only — telemetry would silently fall
  back to the public proxy when the CLI was the only way to set these).
- New global flags `--debug` and `--no-telemetry`, promoted from env-only
  toggles.
- `--proxy-url` (env: `SOCKET_PROXY_URL`) as an explicit CLI knob for the
  public patch proxy.
- New CI guard in the `Release` workflow: the workflow fails before tag
  creation if `CHANGELOG.md` lacks an entry for the version in
  `Cargo.toml`. Blocks every downstream publish (cargo, npm, pypi).

### Changed

- Garbage collection moved out of `apply`. Use `scan --prune`,
  `scan --sync`, or `repair` / `gc` instead. `apply` is now strictly
  non-mutating against `.socket/`: when blobs need to be fetched they go
  to a temp overlay; the persistent cache is never written to.
- Unified JSON envelope (`command` / `status` / `events` / `summary`) for
  `apply`, `list`, `remove`, `repair`. Other subcommands keep their
  pre-v3 ad-hoc shapes for now; see `CLI_CONTRACT.md` for migration status.

## [2.1.4] — 2026-04-09
